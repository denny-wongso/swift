# swift

This repo is keeping track of the feature that I have learnt. The repo is organised as packages, each package is one of the feature.

### How to try out the feature
1. open up the package of the feature you are interested in
2. Inside the package there should be a storyboard and corresponding ViewController
3. Go to the SceneDelegate.swift
4. update the Storyboard name and identifier to the one from the package
5. clean the project and run
